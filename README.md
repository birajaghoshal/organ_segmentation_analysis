Organ segmentation demo at MICCAI19 Bayesian Deep Learning for Medical Imaging tutorial

## Paper link
[DropConnect Is Effective in Modeling Uncertainty of Bayesian Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04569.pdf)

## Run the code
There are two ways to run the code:
- Change the configurations in `config.py` and then run `main.py`  
- Run `Organ_Seg_Analysis.ipynb` in jupyter notebook line by line
